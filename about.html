      <p class="story">
        Hi, I'm Joshua Mazza and I graduated from Rowan University as a History major.
        How I got into coding is a long story, but here's the short version.
        I have a minor in New Media and from one of my classes, I learned a little bit about
        HTML and CSS. This is where my passion for coding came from! My love for coding kept on growing
        and I knew I had to dive deeper into HTML and CSS and other front end developer methods. I then enrolled into Codecademy's "Build Websites from Scratch" course.
        After going through this awesome course, I now have a certificate and hope to get the dream job that I have been looking for: Front End Developer.
